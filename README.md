# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview
Mr. W. Avy, an investor, would like more information regarding trends before the opening of a surf shop. He wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. This will help him determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

### Temperature
- The temperature mean for June is 74.94 degrees F, with minimum/maximum temperatures of 64 and 85 degrees F respectively.
- The temperature mean for December is 71.04 degrees F, with minimum/maximum temperatures of 56 and 83 degrees F respectively.
- 75% of values are above 73 degrees F for June and 69 degrees F for December.

### Precipitation
- The mean amount of precipitation per day in June is 0.14
- The mean amount of precipitation per day in December is 0.22
- 75% of values fall below 0.12 and 0.15 amounts of precipitation per day for June and December respectively

## Summary 

Additional queries were performed to determine the quantity of precipitation in June and December. The precipitation mean for June is 0.14. The precipitation mean for December is 0.22. Since 75% of the time the temperature is above 73 degrees F for June and below 0.12 amounts of precipitation per day, June is a good month to have a surf and ice cream shop open for business. 75% of the time the temperature is above 69 degrees F for December and below 0.15 amounts of precipitation per day. December is not an undesirable time period to have a surf and ice cream shop open. More data collection going forward to look at revenue for the first year by month will be helpful in making determinations going forward regarding if it is beneficial to offer seasonal products- such as hot chocolate, hot tea/coffee, or hot apple cider to bring in more customers during months that are cooler or have heavier precipitation.
